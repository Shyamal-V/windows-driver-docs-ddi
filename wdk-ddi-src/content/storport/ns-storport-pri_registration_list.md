# PRI_REGISTRATION_LIST structure


## -description


The PRI_REGISTRATION_LIST structure is returned in response to a Persistent Reserve In command with ServiceAction = RESERVATION_ACTION_READ_KEYS.


## -syntax


````
typedef struct {
  UCHAR Generation[4];
  UCHAR AdditionalLength[4];
  UCHAR ReservationKeyList[0][8];
} PRI_REGISTRATION_LIST, *PPRI_REGISTRATION_LIST;
````


## -struct-fields




### -field Generation

The Generation field contains a 32-bit counter that is maintained by the device server, which is incremented every time a Persistent Reserve Out command requests a REGISTER, REGISTER AND IGNORE

EXISTING KEY, CLEAR, PREEMPT, or PREEMPT AND ABORT service action.


### -field AdditionalLength

The AdditionalLength field contains a count of the number of bytes in the reservation key list.


### -field ReservationKeyList

 




#### - ReservationKeyList[0]

The reservation key list contains the 8-byte reservation keys for all initiators that have registered by using all ports with the device server.


## -remarks



The <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_persistent_reserve_in.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_PERSISTENT_RESERVE_IN</a> request is used to obtain information about persistent reservations and reservation keys that are active within a device server.
